# MyWebsite - Farm Business Operation

## Project Overview

Welcome to **MyWebsite**, a farm fresh business operation website designed as part of a class project. This website is built using HTML and CSS and aims to offer a smooth and enriching experience for users who are interested in our farm's products, events, and services. The site is user-friendly, with easy navigation and a clear structure. 

This repository contains the source code for the website, and it is ready for deployment or further development. Please note that not all features are fully functional, as this is a work-in-progress.
